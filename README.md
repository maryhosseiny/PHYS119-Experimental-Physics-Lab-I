## Course Description
This first-year physics laboratory uses empirical observation and experimentation to take advantage of unique features of doing physics in a laboratory setting. In this course, I learned how to make observations and measurements, build models that fit those measurements, and derive meaning from the success or failure of those models. I also learned various technical skills including using particular equipment, learning data-analysis techniques, keeping thorough laboratory notes, developing spreadsheet skills, learning statistical methods and developing the ability to communicate results and ideas.

## Learning Goals
#### Making Measurements

Most fundamentally, I learned how to take measurements, something which embraces a range of skills and attitudes in addition to learning how to use specific equipment and procedures. The emphasis will be on the most broadly applicable skills. At the end of this course, I was able to:
- Identify the variables that might control the phenomenon being studied in an experimental situation
- Control experimental variables during an experiment
- Define:
  - Mean
  - Standard deviation
  - Experimental/systematic uncertainty
  - Statistical uncertainty
- Assign appropriate dimensional units to all measured quantities
- Determine the precision of a measurement
- Attach an experimental uncertainty to any measured value, including:
  - Estimating uncertainty by studying distributions in the data
  - Calculating uncertainty for the special case of a Poisson distribution
  - Determining uncertainty due to noise (e.g., in electronics)
  - Ascertaining uncertainty due to instrumental precision
- Identify and categorize the sources of uncertainty in a measurement
- Design measurements that minimize the sources of uncertainty
- Apply tactics for efficient data collection, including:
  - Covering a wide variable range quickly, when possible
  - Evaluating data early and adjusting choices 'on-the-fly'
  - Evaluating whether or not magnitudes, units, and precision of results are reasonable

#### Modelling Data
Learned an essential step in the association of empirical measurements with theory, which is modelling data. This includes building an awareness of how data sets can differ from one another, the acquisition of some technical skills, and the ability to make connections between discrete data and mathematical functions. At the end of Phys 119, I was able to:
- Define:
  - Linear growth
  - Exponential growth
  - Exponential decay
  - Power law behaviour
  - Power law scaling
- Create a two-dimensional scatter plot of data on linear scales
- Provide a verbal description of any given two-dimensional scatter plot of data on linear scales
- Linearize:
  - Exponential distributions, by using semi-log plots
  - Power law distributions, by using log-log plots and power law scaling
- Extract meaning from the slope and intercept of data which has been linearized

#### Statistics and Data
Learned some  basic and proper statistical treatments of data and models. Including understanding how and when to apply certain calculations, and also the development of my ability to make evaluations of my data and models based on these calculations. At the end of Phys 119, I was able to: 
- Calculate:
  - Mean of a data set
  - Standard deviation of a data set
  - Uncertainty in the mean of a data set
- Weigh the relative importance of numbers that have differing uncertainty
- Recognize whether numbers with an associated uncertainty are in agreement with one another or not
- Reduced chi-square statistic, which entails:
  - Weighted, linear least-squares fit to a straight line
  - Weighted, non-linear least-squares fit to a model
  - From each, extract meaning and numerical values with uncertainties of the fit parameters
- Calculate Uncertainty in the slope of a linear model
- Judge whether or not a model fits a data set

#### Higher Level Skills and Attitudes
At the end of Phys 119, I was able to:
- Offer a plausible modification or further tests when confronted by a disagreement with an expected model
- Devise experiments to search for and correct hidden systematic errors when confronted by a disagreement with an expected model
- Develop a new experiment that further tests a successful model after having drawn a conclusion from an experiment
- Write a concise summary of an experiment
